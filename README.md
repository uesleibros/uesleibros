![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C++-fc6c81?style=flat&logo=cplusplus)&nbsp;

I'm currently studying C++, as I believe it's an important programming language with a wide range of applications. Is known for its performance, efficiency, and low-level control, which make it suitable for developing software in areas such as game development, systems programming, and embedded systems. Moreover, C++ is widely used in industry and is a valuable skill for software engineers. I'm excited to continue my learning journey with this powerful language!

## Skills
### Programming Languages:

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-fbfbf1?style=flat&logo=python)&nbsp;
- **JavaScript:** One of the main reasons why I chose this language for my Github profile is because of its flexibility and ease of use. With its intuitive syntax and vast collection of libraries and frameworks, I am able to quickly and efficiently develop complex applications with minimal effort. As an experienced user of this language, I am well-versed in its various features and best practices, allowing me to produce high-quality code that is both performant and maintainable.
